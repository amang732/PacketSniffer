INTRODUCTION 
    A sniffer is an application or device that can read, monitor, and capture network data exchanges and read network packets. 
    If the packets are not encrypted, a sniffer provides a full view of the data inside the packet. 
    Attacker store the incoming and outgoing data into the packet using network sniffer tool. 
    Apart from network sniffer, lots of packet sniffer and packet analysis tools is available which is used to check the sniffed packed. 
    A sniffer (packet sniffer) is a tool that intercepts data flowing in a network. If computers are connected to a local area network that 
    is not filtered or switched, the traffic can be broadcast to all computers contained in the same segment. This doesnâ€™t generally occur, 
    since computers are generally told to ignore all the comings and goings of traffic from other computers. However, in the case of a sniffer, 
    all traffic is shared when the sniffer software commands the Network Interface Card (NIC) to stop ignoring the traffic. The NIC is put into
    promiscuous mode, and it reads communications between computers within a particular segment. This allows the sniffer to seize everything that is flowing in the network, which can lead to the unauthorized access of sensitive data. 
    A packet sniffer can take the form of either a hardware or software solution. A sniffer is also known as a packet analyser.

PROJECT
    This College Project is an attempt to remake the Simplified packet Sniffer in Python3 from Scratch. The goal is to Understand the working of the packet sniffer form inside using socket programming.  Upto this point of time the project is able disect the packet upto layer 4 (that is,
    Transport Layer). 

FUTURE SCOPE
    This Include packet disesction upto layer 7(that is, Application Layer).
    User friendly UI.Tracing the Particular packet stream of UDP and TCP.
    Compatibility with Windows.
    (Future Scope is subjected to change according to the achieved milestone).
